# PathFinderVisualizer
This is a an algorithm visualizer that at the moment has implemented the following features:
1) Generates a maze
2) Solves that maze using one of the following algoritms: A* BFS DFS

You need any IDE that can run python and the pygame library

How to use:
0) Run the application
1) If you want to generate a maze: optimally middle click the square in the upper right and the press space and wait for the maze to finish,
2) Then select a starting point and a ending point by click the left mouse button,
2.1) you can also skip the step 1 and after selecting the start and end generate your own obstacles by clicking anywhere on the grid,
3) You can delete any obstacle generated by the maze or the start and end point using right click,
4) The default set algorithm to run after generating the maze and selecting the start and end is A*,
4.1) you can choose the algorithms using the following buttons: B - BFS | D - DFS | S - A*,
5) Press Space and wait for the algorithm to end,
6) Press C to clear the screen and start with number 1.
